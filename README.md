# Cybersecurity Awareness Website

This project is a part of my Full Stack Development Assignment.  
I created a simple Cybersecurity Awareness webpage and improved it step by step using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript.

# Project Overview

This website explains the basics of Cybersecurity such as definition, common cyber threats, safety tips and security tools.  
The webpage was first made with basic HTML, then CSS was used for styling.
